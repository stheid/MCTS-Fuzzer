# MCTS-Fuzzer

This project implements a novel mcts-based fuzzing algorithm. The Monte Carlo tree search algorithm uses a grammar model to progressively build words from the startword of the grammar.

The implementation here is just the plain algorithm. To execute this algorithm have a look at the [pylibfuzzer repo](https://github.com/stheid/pylibfuzzer)
